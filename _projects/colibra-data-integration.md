## Situation

GlobalLogistics, a multinational supply chain and logistics company, approached our consulting firm with a critical challenge. They were struggling with data inconsistency across their various systems, causing inefficiencies in their supply chain operations and hindering their ability to provide accurate real-time tracking to their customers. Their ecosystem included multiple disparate systems:

- SAP ERP for finance and procurement
- Manhattan Associates for warehouse management
- Oracle Transportation Management System (OTM) for transportation planning
- Salesforce for customer relationship management
- Mega HOPEX for enterprise architecture and business process modeling

Each system had its own set of terminologies and data definitions, leading to confusion and errors when trying to integrate data for analysis or reporting. Additionally, there was a disconnect between their enterprise architecture models in Mega HOPEX and the actual implementation of data structures across their operational systems.

## Task

As the lead Enterprise Data Architect, I was tasked with:

1. Designing and implementing a centralized metadata management system
2. Standardizing terminology across all systems
3. Integrating the new metadata management system with existing tools, especially Mega HOPEX
4. Aligning the enterprise architecture models with the actual data landscape
5. Improving data consistency and accessibility for better decision-making and customer service

## Action

To address GlobalLogistics' challenges, I led a comprehensive data integration project. Here's a detailed breakdown of our approach:

1. **Implementing Collibra Data Intelligence Cloud**

   - Set up Collibra as the central metadata repository
   - Configured the Business Glossary module to store and manage standardized terms
   - Created custom attributes in Collibra to capture logistics-specific metadata (e.g., "mode of transport", "customs requirements")

2. **Integrating Collibra with Mega HOPEX**

   - Developed a custom bi-directional integration between Collibra and Mega HOPEX using their respective APIs
   - Mapped Collibra's business terms to Mega HOPEX's business capability model
   - Synchronized data definitions between Collibra's Business Glossary and Mega HOPEX's conceptual data model
   - Implemented automated updates to ensure changes in either system were reflected in the other

3. **Stakeholder Engagement and Term Standardization**

   - Conducted workshops with representatives from operations, customer service, IT, and enterprise architecture teams
   - Used Collibra's collaboration features to create and refine definitions for key terms, ensuring alignment with the enterprise architecture models in Mega HOPEX
   - Implemented Collibra's workflow capabilities to set up approval processes for new terms and changes to existing definitions, with automated notifications to update Mega HOPEX when approved

4. **System Integration**

   - Leveraged the Mega HOPEX integration to map standardized terms and definitions to specific systems and processes in the enterprise architecture
   - Created ETL processes using Talend to extract metadata from the legacy Oracle TMS and load it into Collibra, with mappings to the corresponding elements in Mega HOPEX
   - Utilized Collibra's out-of-the-box connectors for integrating with SAP ERP and Salesforce, ensuring consistency with the enterprise architecture models
   - Implemented a custom connector for Manhattan Associates using their Integration Framework and Collibra's Data Lineage features, with links to the relevant process models in Mega HOPEX

5. **Data Governance Implementation**

   - Set up data stewardship roles and responsibilities in Collibra, aligned with the organizational structure modeled in Mega HOPEX
   - Configured Collibra's data governance workflows for term approval, issue management, and change requests, with integration to Mega HOPEX for impact analysis
   - Implemented data quality rules in Collibra to monitor the consistency of key logistics data elements across systems, using business rules derived from Mega HOPEX process models

6. **Actionable Metadata and Analytics**

   - Integrated Collibra with GlobalLogistics' Tableau environment for consistent reporting, using the business capability model from Mega HOPEX to organize dashboards
   - Developed a 'track and trace' API using Collibra's metadata to standardize shipment status information, with the API design informed by the service-oriented architecture modeled in Mega HOPEX
   - Implemented Collibra's Reference Data Management module to maintain consistent code lists across all systems, synchronized with the master data management strategy outlined in Mega HOPEX

7. **Training and Change Management**
   - Conducted training sessions on both Collibra and Mega HOPEX usage for data stewards, enterprise architects, and business users
   - Created a comprehensive data dictionary in Collibra, accessible to all employees and linked to relevant enterprise architecture artifacts in Mega HOPEX
   - Developed a change management plan to ensure adoption of the new standardized terms and processes, using Mega HOPEX to model and communicate the target state of data management practices

## Result

The implementation of this comprehensive data integration project, with Collibra and Mega HOPEX at its core, led to significant improvements for GlobalLogistics:

1. **Data Consistency**: Achieved a 95% reduction in terminology inconsistencies across departments and systems, with enterprise architecture models now accurately reflecting the actual data landscape.

2. **Operational Efficiency**:

   - 40% reduction in customer support tickets related to shipment status queries
   - 25% improvement in efficiency when handling exceptions in the logistics process
   - 30% faster impact analysis for proposed changes, thanks to the integration between Collibra and Mega HOPEX

3. **Enhanced Customer Service**: The 'track and trace' API, built on standardized metadata from Collibra and aligned with the service architecture in Mega HOPEX, allowed customers to integrate real-time shipment tracking into their own systems, improving satisfaction and reducing support calls.

4. **Improved Decision Making**: With consistent metadata across systems and alignment with enterprise architecture models, GlobalLogistics was able to implement advanced analytics, including:

   - Predictive models for estimating shipment delays
   - Optimization algorithms for route planning, informed by end-to-end process models in Mega HOPEX
   - Real-time dashboards for monitoring global logistics operations, organized by business capabilities

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: The centralized metadata repository in Collibra, combined with the process and control models in Mega HOPEX, improved GlobalLogistics' ability to respond to customs and trade compliance audits, reducing the time required for compliance reporting by 60%.

6. **Cost Savings**: By eliminating data discrepancies, improving operational efficiency, and better aligning IT investments with business capabilities, GlobalLogistics estimated annual savings of $7 million.

7. **Scalability**: The standardized data model, integration architecture, and its alignment with the enterprise architecture in Mega HOPEX positioned GlobalLogistics to more easily integrate future acquisitions and new technologies into their ecosystem.

8. **IT-Business Alignment**: The integration between Collibra and Mega HOPEX created a shared language between IT and business teams, improving collaboration and ensuring that technology investments were directly tied to business outcomes.

This project not only solved GlobalLogistics' immediate data challenges but also positioned them as a leader in data-driven logistics operations, improving their competitive advantage in the market. The seamless integration between operational data management in Collibra and strategic enterprise architecture in Mega HOPEX provided a solid foundation for ongoing digital transformation initiatives.
