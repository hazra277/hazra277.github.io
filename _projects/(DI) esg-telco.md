## Situation

BelgiCom, a leading telecommunications company in Belgium, will face significant challenges in adapting to the upcoming European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) set to take effect in 2025. The company's existing data infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle the comprehensive reporting requirements across Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) dimensions. Specific issues will include:

- **Data Silos**: Critical ESG-related information will be scattered across various departments, making consolidated reporting challenging.

  _Example_: Energy consumption data for cell towers will be stored in a legacy system, while data center information will be in a separate custom-built solution. This disparity will make it difficult to calculate total network emissions accurately.

- **Limited Visibility**: Real-time tracking of key ESG metrics, such as carbon emissions from data centers or energy usage in cell towers, will be inadequate.

  _Example_: When stakeholders request current year-to-date carbon footprint data, compiling this information may take several weeks, potentially resulting in outdated reports.

- **Inefficient Reporting**: Manual data collection and reconciliation for sustainability reports will be time-consuming and prone to errors.

  _Example_: The annual sustainability report will require input from multiple department heads, each using their own spreadsheets and definitions of metrics, leading to inconsistencies and a lengthy compilation process.

- **Compliance Risks**: The inability to accurately track and report on ESG metrics will pose significant regulatory and reputational risks.

  _Example_: In a mock audit, BelgiCom may struggle to provide comprehensive evidence for all of its claimed environmental initiatives, potentially risking accusations of greenwashing.

- **Supply Chain Opacity**: Lack of transparency in supplier practices will make it difficult to assess and report on Scope 3 emissions and social compliance throughout the value chain.

  _Example_: If concerns arise about the sustainability practices of a key equipment supplier, BelgiCom may face challenges in quickly determining the impact on its operations and ESG commitments.

- **Complexity of ESG Disclosures**: The team will likely struggle to break down the EFRAG disclosure requirements into actionable data points and measures.

  _Example_: When analyzing the climate change disclosure (E1), the team may identify numerous distinct data points required, many of which may not be currently tracked or may be tracked inconsistently across different business units.

- **Reliance on External Data**: Much of the required ESG data will not be available within BelgiCom's systems and will need to be sourced from suppliers or third-party providers.

  _Example_: Calculating Scope 3 emissions will require data from multiple suppliers, each potentially using different reporting formats and timelines, complicating the data collection process.

- **Data Standardization Challenges**: Existing internal data may not align with the categories and classifications required by ESG reporting standards.

  _Example_: While ESRS will require reporting on multiple gender categories, BelgiCom's HR system may only capture limited gender data, necessitating system and process updates.

## Task

As the Enterprise Data Architect, my responsibilities will include:

1. Designing a comprehensive data architecture to support ESG reporting and enhance telecom operations within Belgium.
2. Integrating disparate data sources to create a single source of truth for ESG metrics.
3. Implementing data governance practices to ensure data quality and compliance with ESRS.
4. Developing a scalable solution that can adapt to evolving ESG standards and business needs.
5. Enabling improved visibility into key ESG and telecom network performance indicators.
6. Facilitating easier access to ESG data for reporting and decision-making across the organization.
7. Breaking down EFRAG disclosure requirements into specific, measurable data points and dimensions.
8. Developing strategies to collect and integrate data from external sources, including suppliers and third-party providers.
9. Aligning internal data classifications with ESG reporting requirements, including necessary system updates.

## Action

To address these challenges, we will implement a multi-faceted approach leveraging several key technologies:

1. **Data Integration and Governance with Collibra**:

   - Implement Collibra's Data Catalog to create a comprehensive inventory of all ESG-related data assets across the organization.

     _Example_: We will catalog all data sources related to energy consumption across BelgiCom's network infrastructure. This may include smart meter data from cell towers, energy usage logs from data centers, and fuel consumption records for backup generators. By creating this inventory, we aim to identify all relevant data sources for calculating our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, ensuring no critical information is overlooked in our ESG reporting.

   - Utilize Collibra's Data Lineage features to map data flows from source systems to ESG reports, ensuring traceability and auditability.

     _Example_: We will create a data lineage map for our carbon emissions reporting process. This map will trace data from individual smart meters at cell sites, through our data aggregation systems, to the final calculations in our ESG reporting tool. If an auditor questions a specific emissions figure, we can use this lineage to quickly trace back to the source data, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of our reporting.

   - Establish a Business Glossary to standardize ESG terminology across the organization, aligning with ESRS definitions.

     _Example_: We will create standardized definitions for key ESG terms like "renewable energy," "e-waste," and "digital inclusion." For instance, we'll define "renewable energy" as "energy derived from wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal sources, excluding nuclear power," aligning with ESRS specifications. This common language will help ensure consistent reporting across all departments and avoid misinterpretations that could lead to reporting errors.

   - Set up Data Governance workflows to manage data quality, ownership, and access rights for sensitive ESG information.

     _Example_: We will implement a data governance workflow for managing our supplier diversity data. This workflow will designate the procurement team as data owners, require quarterly updates of supplier information, and include automated checks for data completeness and accuracy. Access to detailed supplier data will be restricted to relevant team members to protect sensitive information, while aggregated data will be made available for ESG reporting purposes.

2. **Enterprise Architecture Modeling with LeanIX**:

   - Model the telecom ecosystem within Belgium, including ESG touchpoints, to identify areas for optimization and risk.

     _Example_: We will create a detailed model of BelgiCom's network infrastructure, including cell towers, data centers, and fiber optic networks. This model will incorporate ESG-related attributes such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, and proximity to environmentally sensitive areas. By visualizing this information, we may identify opportunities to optimize our network layout for reduced environmental impact, such as relocating energy-intensive equipment to areas with access to renewable energy sources.

   - Use Business Capability Modeling to redesign workflows for efficient ESG data collection and reporting.

     _Example_: We will map the current process for collecting and reporting on electronic waste (e-waste) management. This may reveal that e-waste data is being manually collected by multiple teams using different methods. We can then redesign this process, creating a centralized e-waste tracking system that automatically updates our ESG reporting dashboard, potentially reducing data collection time and improving accuracy.

   - Leverage IT Component Mapping to align technology investments with ESG goals and reporting needs.

     _Example_: By mapping our IT components, we may discover that 30% of our servers are over five years old and energy-inefficient. This insight could lead to a targeted upgrade initiative, replacing these servers with more energy-efficient models. We can then track the impact of this upgrade on our overall energy consumption and carbon footprint, directly linking our IT investments to our ESG goals.

   - Implement Risk Management capabilities to proactively identify and mitigate ESG-related risks in the telecom infrastructure.

     _Example_: We will use LeanIX to create a risk matrix for our cell tower locations, considering factors such as flood risk, proximity to protected habitats, and community impact. This could help us prioritize resilience measures for high-risk sites and inform future site selection to minimize environmental and social risks.

3. **Data Visualization with Tableau**:

   - Create interactive dashboards for monitoring of key ESG metrics.

     _Example_: We will develop a "Network Sustainability Dashboard" that visualizes real-time energy consumption and carbon emissions for each of our major infrastructure components (cell towers, data centers, office buildings). This dashboard will include features such as heat maps showing high-consumption areas, trend lines for emissions over time, and the ability to drill down into specific sites or regions for detailed analysis.

   - Develop custom reports aligned with ESRS requirements for regulatory submission.

     _Example_: We will create a template for ESRS E1 (Climate Change) reporting, pulling data from various sources to populate required disclosures such as Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, energy consumption, and climate-related targets. This report will automatically update with the latest data and flag any areas where we're missing information or falling short of targets.

   - Implement analytics to assess ESG performance and identify areas for improvement.

     _Example_: We will build a predictive model that analyzes historical energy consumption data alongside factors such as network traffic, weather conditions, and equipment age. This model could help identify potential equipment failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance that reduces both downtime and energy waste.

4. **System Integration with MuleSoft**:

   - Develop APIs to connect various data sources, including IoT devices for environmental monitoring of network infrastructure.

     _Example_: We will create an API that integrates data from smart meters on our cell towers with our central energy management system. This API will provide real-time energy consumption data, allowing us to quickly identify and respond to unusual spikes in energy use that could indicate equipment malfunction or inefficiency.

   - Create data pipelines to automate the flow of ESG data from operational systems to reporting tools.

     _Example_: We will implement a data pipeline that automatically collects and processes data on network equipment lifecycle. This pipeline will track equipment from procurement through to end-of-life, providing data for our e-waste management reporting and helping us optimize equipment use to reduce waste.

   - Implement event-driven architecture to enable timely updates of ESG metrics.

     _Example_: We will set up an event-driven system that triggers alerts when certain ESG thresholds are crossed. For instance, if a data center's Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) exceeds a set limit, it will automatically notify the facilities management team and update our ESG dashboard, allowing for quick corrective action.

5. **Additional ESG-Specific Tools**:

   - Integrate Watershed for detailed carbon accounting, particularly for complex Scope 3 emissions calculations.

     _Example_: We will use Watershed to calculate the emissions associated with our customers' use of our services (a Scope 3 category). By inputting data on network usage, device types, and energy mix in different regions, we can estimate the carbon footprint of our service provision and identify opportunities for reduction, such as encouraging the use of more energy-efficient devices.

   - Implement Sphera for comprehensive ESG performance management, including scenario planning for climate risk (Standard E1).

     _Example_: We will use Sphera to model the potential impact of various climate scenarios on our infrastructure. For instance, we could simulate the effect of increased flooding risk on our low-lying cell towers, helping us develop adaptation strategies and make more resilient infrastructure investments.

6. **ESG Disclosure Analysis and Mapping**:

   - Conduct a comprehensive analysis of EFRAG disclosure requirements, breaking them down into specific measures and dimensions.

     _Example_: For the ESRS S1 (Own Workforce) standard, we will break down the required disclosures into specific data points. This might include creating a detailed list of metrics such as total number of employees, breakdown by contract type, gender pay gap figures, and employee turnover rates. For each metric, we will specify the exact calculation method, data source, and responsible department.

   - Create a detailed mapping between required ESG disclosures and available data sources, identifying gaps and necessary data transformations.

     _Example_: In mapping our data for the ESRS E3 (Water and Marine Resources) disclosure, we might discover that while we have detailed water consumption data for our data centers, we lack information on water use in our office buildings. This gap identification would prompt us to install water meters in our offices and integrate this data into our reporting system.

7. **External Data Integration Strategy**:

   - Develop a supplier data portal using MuleSoft to standardize and automate the collection of ESG data from external partners.

     _Example_: We will create a secure online portal where our top 50 suppliers can directly input their carbon emissions data, labor practices information, and other relevant ESG metrics. This portal will include data validation rules to ensure consistency (e.g., checking that reported emissions fall within expected ranges based on the supplier's size and industry).

   - Implement data quality checks and validation rules to ensure the integrity of externally sourced data.

     _Example_: For supplier-reported carbon emissions data, we will implement an automated check that compares the reported figures against industry benchmarks. If a supplier's reported emissions are significantly lower than the industry average, the system will flag this for manual review, potentially prompting us to request additional documentation or clarification from the supplier.

8. **Data Classification Alignment**:

   - Conduct a gap analysis between existing internal data classifications and ESG reporting requirements.

     _Example_: In reviewing our workforce data classifications, we might find that our current system only categorizes employees as "full-time" or "part-time," while ESRS S1 requires reporting on additional categories such as "temporary" and "non-guaranteed hours" workers. This gap analysis would inform necessary updates to our HR systems and data collection processes.

   - Implement system updates and data transformation processes to align internal data with ESG standards.

     _Example_: To address the workforce classification gap identified above, we will update our HR system to include all required employee categories. We will then develop a data transformation process that maps our historical employee data to these new categories where possible, ensuring we can provide accurate historical trend data in our ESG reports.

9. **Integrating ESG Data with Core Telecom Operations**:

   - Leverage ESG data to optimize network performance and reduce operational costs.

     _Example_: We will integrate our energy consumption data from cell towers with our network performance metrics. By analyzing this combined dataset, we aim to identify opportunities for energy optimization without compromising service quality. For instance, we might discover that certain low-traffic periods allow for reducing power to some network elements, potentially lowering our energy costs and emissions while maintaining required service levels.

   - Use operational efficiency improvements to drive ESG goals.

     _Example_: Our network planning team will incorporate ESG data into their decision-making process for network expansion and upgrades. By considering factors such as local renewable energy availability and population density alongside traditional metrics like coverage and capacity, we can potentially optimize our network layout to reduce both operational costs and environmental impact. For instance, prioritizing the use of renewable energy in high-consumption areas could significantly reduce our carbon footprint.

   - Implement predictive maintenance using ESG and operational data.

     _Example_: We will develop a predictive maintenance model that combines equipment performance data with environmental data such as temperature and humidity. This model could help us anticipate equipment failures before they occur, reducing both network downtime and the need for emergency repairs. By optimizing our maintenance schedules, we can potentially reduce fuel consumption for maintenance vehicles and extend the lifespan of our equipment, contributing to our waste reduction goals.

10. **Addressing Data Collection and Standardization Challenges**:

    - Develop strategies for aligning external data with internal data standards.

      _Example_: To handle the diverse formats of supplier emissions data, we will implement a data transformation layer in our MuleSoft integration. This layer will automatically convert incoming data to our standardized format, using predefined mapping rules. For instance, if a supplier reports emissions in pounds CO2e and we use metric tons, the system will automatically perform the conversion.

    - Implement automated data validation and standardization processes.

      _Example_: We will use Collibra's data quality features to set up automated checks for incoming ESG data. These checks will include range validations (e.g., flagging unusually high or low emissions values), completeness checks (ensuring all required fields are populated), and consistency checks (comparing new data against historical trends). Any data failing these checks will be automatically flagged for review, ensuring that only high-quality data enters our ESG reporting system.

    - Address real-time vs. batch data ingestion requirements.

      _Example_: We will configure MuleSoft to handle both real-time and batch data ingestion. For real-time data, such as energy consumption from our IoT-enabled cell towers, we'll implement event-driven APIs that update our ESG dashboards as soon as new data is available. For batch processes, like quarterly supplier emissions reports, we'll set up scheduled jobs to import and process this data during off-peak hours to minimize system load.

11. **Comprehensive Risk Management and Scenario Planning**:

    - Model and mitigate specific ESG risks using LeanIX.

      _Example_: We will use LeanIX to create a comprehensive ESG risk model for our operations. This will include mapping our infrastructure against climate risk factors such as flood zones, areas prone to wildfires, and regions likely to experience extreme heat. For each identified risk, we'll develop mitigation strategies. For instance, for cell towers in flood-prone areas, we might plan for elevated equipment installations or improved waterproofing measures.

    - Integrate climate scenario planning into long-term business strategy.

      _Example_: Using Sphera's climate scenario modeling capabilities, we will simulate the potential impacts of different climate scenarios on our operations over the next 30 years. This might include modeling the effects of sea-level rise on our coastal infrastructure, increased storm frequency on our wireless networks, or rising temperatures on our cooling costs for data centers. We'll use these insights to inform our long-term infrastructure investments, potentially leading to decisions such as relocating vulnerable facilities or investing in more resilient technologies.

    - Develop adaptive strategies based on risk assessments.

      _Example_: Based on our risk modeling, we will develop a set of adaptive strategies for different climate scenarios. For instance, if our models predict an increased likelihood of power outages due to extreme weather, we might accelerate our investments in on-site renewable energy and battery storage for critical infrastructure. These strategies will be reviewed and updated annually as part of our business planning process, ensuring that our ESG risk management remains dynamic and forward-looking.
