I also ensured seamless integration with the client’s existing BI tools by creating optimized views and data models to support their reporting needs.

   _Example: I designed and optimized the data models so that business users could easily generate reports on key metrics like shipment efficiency and cost savings, reducing reporting time by 60%._

4. **Data Governance and Standardization:**
   I implemented data governance practices, focusing on data quality and consistency. This included standardizing data formats across the organization and setting up automated data quality checks, improving the accuracy of insights derived from the data.

   _Example: I enhanced data accuracy by 25% by standardizing data formats and implementing governance checks, ensuring that the client’s logistics data was clean and reliable._

### **Result:**
The comprehensive data architecture we implemented significantly transformed the client’s data management and analytics capabilities:

1. **Improved Data Accessibility:**
