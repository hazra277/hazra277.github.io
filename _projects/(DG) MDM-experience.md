## Company Overview: EcoTrace Solutions

EcoTrace Solutions is a pioneering company in the realm of supply chain transparency and sustainability. They specialize in creating digital solutions that unveil every facet of a product's journey, from raw materials to end consumers. Their mission is to architect change in the global marketplace by embracing circular ecosystems and meeting the growing demand for ethical sourcing and sustainable supply chains.

## Year 1: Laying the Foundation

### Situation

In the first year of our engagement, EcoTrace Solutions was facing several critical challenges that aligned with the common issues identified in the Master Data Management (MDM) landscape:

1. **Data Fragmentation**: Product information was scattered across multiple systems, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies.

   _Example_: The company had three separate databases for product information:

   - An ERP system containing basic product details and pricing
   - A Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system with detailed specifications and bill of materials
   - A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system with product-related customer feedback and issues

   These systems often contained conflicting information. For instance, a sustainable bamboo t-shirt (product ID: ECO-TS-001) was listed with different materials in the ERP (100% bamboo) and PLM (95% bamboo, 5% elastane) systems.

2. **Limited Visibility**: The company struggled to trace products beyond tier 1 suppliers, hindering their ability to ensure ethical sourcing.

   _Example_: For their best-selling organic cotton jeans (product ID: ECO-JN-002), EcoTrace could only trace the supply chain to their direct supplier, GreenFabrics Inc. They had no visibility into the cotton farms or processing facilities further up the supply chain, making it impossible to verify claims of organic and fair-trade practices.

3. **Regulatory Pressures**: Upcoming regulations like the Ecodesign Requirements for Sustainable Products Initiative (ESPR) necessitated a more robust data management approach.

   _Example_: The ESPR would require EcoTrace to provide detailed information on the environmental impact of each product throughout its lifecycle. For their recycled polyester jacket (product ID: ECO-JK-003), they needed to track and report:

   - The source of the recycled materials
   - Energy consumption during manufacturing
   - Transportation emissions
   - End-of-life recyclability
     Their current systems couldn't consolidate this information effectively.

4. **Manual Processes**: Data collection and analysis were largely manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors.

   _Example_: To create a sustainability report for their vegan leather bag (product ID: ECO-BG-004), the sustainability team had to:

   1. Extract data from the ERP system for sales and pricing
   2. Manually input material composition from the PLM system
   3. Calculate carbon footprint using a separate spreadsheet
   4. Compile customer feedback from the CRM system
      This process took an average of 3 days per product and often resulted in data entry errors.

5. **Stakeholder Demands**: Customers and investors were increasingly demanding transparency in the supply chain, which EcoTrace couldn't fully provide.

   _Example_: A major retail partner, GreenMart, requested detailed supply chain information for all products, including:

   - Names and locations of all suppliers up to tier 3
   - Certifications for ethical labor practices
   - Water usage in production
   - Transportation routes and associated emissions
     EcoTrace could only provide partial information, risking the partnership worth $5 million annually.

### Task

As Enterprise Data Architects, our team was brought in to address these challenges. Our specific responsibilities in Year 1 included:

1. Assessing the current data landscape and identifying gaps in the supply chain data.
2. Designing a comprehensive Master Data Management (MDM) strategy tailored for supply chain transparency.
3. Establishing initial data governance policies and procedures.
4. Creating a roadmap for phased implementation of the MDM solution.
5. Initiating the process of data cleansing and standardization.

### Action

To tackle these challenges, we took the following steps in Year 1:

1. **Data Audit and Gap Analysis**:

   - Conducted a thorough audit of existing data sources, including ERP systems, supplier databases, and product catalogs.
   - Identified critical data elements required for supply chain transparency, such as material composition, supplier information, and production processes.

   _Example_: We created a detailed data inventory for the organic cotton jeans (ECO-JN-002):

   | Data Element          | Current Source | Data Quality | Gap                   |
   | --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
   | Product Name          | ERP            | High         | None                  |
   | Material Composition  | PLM            | Medium       | Inconsistent with ERP |
   | Tier 1 Supplier       | ERP            | High         | None                  |
   | Tier 2-3 Suppliers    | N/A            | N/A          | Missing               |
   | Organic Certification | Paper files    | Low          | Not digitized         |
   | Water Usage           | Spreadsheets   | Low          | Not integrated        |
   | Carbon Footprint      | N/A            | N/A          | Not calculated        |

2. **MDM Strategy Development**:

   - Designed a conceptual centralized MDM architecture to serve as a single source of truth for product and supplier data.

   - Integrate MDM with key business processes

   Phase 3 (Year 5-6): Optimization

   - Implement advanced MDM features (e.g., hierarchy management)
   - Automate data governance processes
   - Integrate with external data sources for enhanced visibility

5. **Initial Data Cleansing and Standardization**:

   - Began the process of cleaning and standardizing product data as a pilot initiative.
   - Developed preliminary data quality rules and standards.

   _Example_: Data Cleansing Pilot for Sustainable Bamboo T-shirt (ECO-TS-001):

   a. Identified data quality issues:

   - Inconsistent material composition across systems
   - Missing sustainability certifications
   - Incomplete supplier information

   b. Developed data quality rules:

   - Material composition must be consistent across all systems
   - All products must have associated sustainability certifications
   - Supplier information must include contact details and certification status

   c. Initiated manual data cleansing process:

   - Reconciled material composition (95% bamboo, 5% elastane) across ERP and PLM systems
   - Digitized and linked sustainability certifications to the product record
   - Updated supplier information with missing details

### Result

By the end of the first year, we had achieved several initial outcomes:

1. **Comprehensive Data Landscape**: Gained a clear understanding of the current data ecosystem, including sources, quality issues, and gaps.

   _Example_: Created a detailed data map showing the flow of product information across 5 key systems (ERP, PLM, CRM, Quality Management, and Sustainability Tracking), identifying 37 critical data elements for supply chain transparency.

2. **MDM Strategy Alignment**: Secured executive buy-in for the MDM initiative and its importance in achieving supply chain transparency.

   _Example_: Presented the MDM strategy to the executive board, resulting in approval for the creation of a Chief Data Officer position and allocation of initial budget for the MDM program.

3. **Data Governance Framework**: Established the foundational elements of a data governance program.

   _Example_: Drafted initial data governance policies for product and supplier data, and formed a cross-functional team to further develop and implement these policies.

4. **Improved Data Awareness**: Raised awareness across the organization about data quality issues and their impact on business operations.

   _Example_: Conducted 5 company-wide workshops on data quality, reaching 150 employees across various departments. Post-workshop surveys showed a 40% increase in understanding of data quality importance.

5. **Initial Data Quality Improvements**: Achieved tangible improvements in data quality through the pilot data cleansing initiative.

# Year 3: Advancing Supply Chain Transparency with MDM

## Situation

By Year 3, EcoTrace Solutions had made significant progress in laying the groundwork for their MDM initiative. However, they now faced new challenges as they moved from planning to implementation:

1. **Data Integration Complexity**: While the company had identified its data sources, integrating them proved more complex than anticipated.

   _Example_: The product lifecycle management (PLM) system used a different product classification scheme than the ERP system. For instance, the sustainable bamboo t-shirt (ECO-TS-001) was classified under "Apparel > Tops > T-shirts" in the PLM but "Clothing > Casual Wear > Shirts" in the ERP.

2. **Scaling Data Governance**: The initial data governance framework struggled to keep pace with the growing volume and complexity of data.

   _Example_: The data steward for product data was overwhelmed, handling over 500 data quality issues per week manually. This led to a backlog of unresolved issues, with the average resolution time increasing from 2 days to 2 weeks.

3. **Resistance to Change**: Some departments were reluctant to adopt new MDM processes, fearing loss of control over their data.

   _Example_: The marketing team continued to maintain their own product database, arguing that the central MDM system didn't capture the nuanced product descriptions they needed for campaigns.

4. **Expanding Data Domains**: As EcoTrace moved beyond product data, they struggled to apply MDM principles to supplier and customer data effectively.

   _Example_: Supplier data was particularly challenging, with multiple departments (Procurement, Quality Assurance, Sustainability) maintaining separate supplier records with conflicting information.

5. **Real-time Data Needs**: Business users increasingly demanded real-time access to master data, putting strain on the existing batch-oriented systems.

   _Example_: The sales team needed up-to-date product sustainability scores during client meetings but often found the data was several days old, leading to potential misrepresentations.

## Task
