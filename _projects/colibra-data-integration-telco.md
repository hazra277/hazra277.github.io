## Action

To address Telenet's challenges, we could implement a comprehensive data integration project. Here's a detailed breakdown of our proposed approach:

1. **Implementing Collibra Data Intelligence Cloud**

   - We can set up Collibra as the central metadata repository
   - We could configure the Business Glossary module to store and manage standardized telecom industry terms
   - We can create custom attributes in Collibra to capture telco-specific metadata (e.g., "network element type", "spectrum band", "service level agreement parameters")
   - Example: We could create a standardized definition for "Network Slicing" that includes specific parameters for different service types (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC) in the 5G context.

2. **Integrating Collibra with LeanIX**

   - We can develop a custom bi-directional integration between Collibra and LeanIX using their respective APIs
   - We could map Collibra's business terms to LeanIX's business capability model and IT component inventory
   - We can synchronize data definitions between Collibra's Business Glossary and LeanIX's data object catalog
   - We could implement automated updates to ensure changes in either system are reflected in the other
   - Example: When a new IT application supporting a 5G use case is added in LeanIX, it could automatically trigger the creation of related data concepts and lineage in Collibra, ensuring alignment between IT portfolio and data management.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement and Term Standardization**

   - We can conduct workshops with representatives from network operations, customer service, IT, and enterprise architecture teams
   - We could use Collibra's collaboration features to create and refine definitions for key terms, ensuring alignment with the enterprise architecture models in LeanIX
   - We can implement Collibra's workflow capabilities to set up approval processes for new terms and changes to existing definitions, with automated notifications to update LeanIX when approved
   - Example: We could standardize the definition of "Network Quality of Service (QoS)" across all systems, aligning it with the KPIs defined in LeanIX's capability model and industry standards for different service types (voice, data, IoT).

4. **System Integration**

   - We can leverage the LeanIX integration to map standardized terms and definitions to specific IT components and business processes in the enterprise architecture
   - We could create ETL processes using Informatica to extract metadata from Ericsson's network management system and Nokia's RAN equipment, loading it into Collibra with mappings to the corresponding elements in LeanIX
   - We can utilize Collibra's out-of-the-box connectors for integrating with SAP and Salesforce, ensuring consistency with the enterprise architecture models
   - We could implement a custom connector for Amdocs using their API and Collibra's Data Lineage features, with links to the relevant application components in LeanIX
   - Example: We can create a unified view of network performance by integrating data from Ericsson (core network), Nokia (RAN), and customer experience data from Amdocs and Salesforce, all mapped to the end-to-end service delivery model in LeanIX.

5. **Data Governance Implementation**

   - We could set up data stewardship roles and responsibilities in Collibra, aligned with the organizational structure and IT ownership model in LeanIX
   - We can configure Collibra's data governance workflows for term approval, issue management, and change requests, with integration to LeanIX for impact analysis on IT components
   - We could implement data quality rules in Collibra to monitor the consistency of key telecom data elements across systems, using business rules derived from LeanIX process and capability models
   - Example: We can establish a data quality rule to ensure that all network events are properly categorized and associated with the correct network elements and services, with alerts sent to the responsible network operations team if violations occur.

6. **Actionable Metadata and Analytics**

   - We could integrate Collibra with Telenet's Tableau environment for consistent reporting, using the business capability model from LeanIX to organize dashboards
   - We can develop a 'Network Health' API using Collibra's metadata to standardize performance metrics across different network technologies and vendors, with the API design informed by the service-oriented architecture modeled in LeanIX
   - We could implement Collibra's Reference Data Management module to maintain consistent code lists for network elements, service types, and customer segments across all systems, synchronized with the IT component inventory in LeanIX
   - Example: We can create a real-time dashboard that shows end-to-end service performance, correlating data from core network, RAN, and customer experience systems, allowing for proactive issue resolution and capacity planning.

7. **Training and Change Management**
   - We could conduct training sessions on both Collibra and LeanIX usage for data stewards, enterprise architects, network engineers, and business users
   - We can create a comprehensive data dictionary in Collibra, accessible to all employees and linked to relevant IT components and capabilities in LeanIX
   - We could develop a change management plan to ensure adoption of the new standardized terms and processes, using LeanIX to model and communicate the target state of data management practices
   - Example: We can create role-based training modules that show how different users (e.g., network engineers, customer service reps, product managers) could leverage the new integrated data landscape to improve their daily operations and decision-making processes.
