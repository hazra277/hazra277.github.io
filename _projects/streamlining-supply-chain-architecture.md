## Situation

GlobalLogistics, a leading player in the global supply chain and logistics industry, was grappling with significant challenges in its data management and integration processes:

- **Fragmented Data Landscape**: The company operated across 50+ countries, resulting in siloed data across numerous legacy systems and newer cloud-based platforms.

  - _Example_: The European division used SAP for order management, while the Asian division relied on Oracle. This disparity led to inconsistencies in order tracking and fulfillment processes.

- **Lack of Data Visibility**: Supply chain managers struggled to gain a holistic view of operations, leading to inefficiencies and delayed decision-making.

  - _Example_: When a major customer inquired about a bulk order's status, it took an average of 4 hours to compile the information from various systems, causing customer dissatisfaction.

- **Inconsistent Data Governance**: Different regions followed varied data standards, making it difficult to ensure data quality and compliance.

  - _Example_: The North American team used 'zip code' while the European team used 'postal code', leading to address validation errors and shipping delays.

- **Integration Complexities**: New system integrations were time-consuming and often disrupted existing data flows.

  - _Example_: Integrating a new last-mile delivery tracking system in the APAC region took 6 months and caused data inconsistencies with the central ERP for 3 weeks.

- **Limited Cross-functional Collaboration**: There was a significant gap between IT architecture teams and data governance personnel.
  - _Example_: When implementing a new data quality rule for product codes, it took 3 weeks of back-and-forth communication between the data governance team and IT to properly implement and test the change.

These challenges were impacting GlobalLogistics' ability to optimize its supply chain operations and maintain its competitive edge in the fast-paced logistics industry.

## Task

As the lead Enterprise Data Architect, my primary responsibilities were to:

1. Design and implement a unified data architecture that could seamlessly integrate data from diverse sources across the global supply chain.
2. Establish robust data lineage tracking to enhance visibility and traceability of data flows.
3. Create a comprehensive mapping of the technical infrastructure supporting critical data flows.
4. Facilitate collaboration between data governance and IT architecture teams to ensure alignment of data strategies.
5. Develop a flexible integration framework to accommodate new systems while maintaining strict governance rules.
6. Improve overall system integration and data flow visibility to drive operational efficiencies.

## Action

To address these challenges, I spearheaded a comprehensive data architecture overhaul leveraging Collibra for data governance and Mega HOPEX for enterprise architecture management. Here's a detailed breakdown of our approach:

1. **Data Landscape Analysis**

   - Conducted a thorough assessment of existing data sources, including 20+ ERP systems, 15 warehouse management systems, and numerous custom applications.
   - _Example_: Created a detailed inventory of data fields across systems, identifying 37 different ways 'customer name' was stored and used across the organization.

2. **Unified Data Model Design**

   - Developed a global data model that standardized key supply chain entities (e.g., orders, shipments, inventory) across all regions.
   - _Example_: Standardized the 'order status' field to have 8 globally consistent values, replacing over 30 region-specific status types.

3. **Data Lineage Implementation**

   - Leveraged Collibra's Data Lineage feature to map data flows from source systems to reporting layers.
   - _Example_: Created a visual lineage for the 'On-Time Delivery' KPI, tracking its journey from order placement in SAP, through warehouse picking in Manhattan Associates WMS, to final delivery status in the custom last-mile application.

4. **Technical Infrastructure Mapping**

   - Utilized Mega HOPEX to create a comprehensive map of the technical infrastructure supporting data flows.
   - _Example_: Mapped out the entire journey of an order, from the web application server in AWS, through the order management system in the on-premises data center, to the regional warehouse management system in Azure.

5. **Cross-functional Collaboration Framework**

   - Established a joint working group between data governance and IT architecture teams.
   - _Example_: Implemented a weekly 'Data Governance and Architecture Sync' meeting, where we collaboratively designed and implemented a new data quality rule for shipment weights, reducing inconsistencies by 85%.

6. **Flexible Integration Framework**

   - Designed a microservices-based integration layer using Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming.
   - _Example_: Created a 'shipment update' event stream that allowed real-time propagation of status changes across systems, reducing status update latency from hours to seconds.

7. **Data Quality Management**

   - Implemented Collibra's Data Quality feature to monitor and improve the quality of critical supply chain data elements.
   - _Example_: Set up an automated check for address data quality, flagging potential issues before shipment and reducing return-to-sender instances by 60%.

8. **Governance Policy Enforcement**

   - Used Mega HOPEX to model and enforce data governance policies across the technical landscape.
   - _Example_: Modeled and enforced a new data retention policy for customer data, ensuring compliance with GDPR across all European operations.

9. **Training and Change Management**
   - Conducted extensive training sessions for supply chain managers, data stewards, and IT personnel on the new data architecture and governance processes.
   - _Example_: Developed a gamified e-learning module on data governance basics, achieving a 95% completion rate among 500+ employees within the first month.
